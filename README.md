# Structure-Property Correlations for Magnesium Alloys
Welcome!

Magnesium alloys are emerging as promising alternatives to traditional orthopedic implant materials thanks to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and impressive mechanical characteristics. However, their rapid _in-vivo_ degradation presents challenges, notably in upholding mechanical integrity over time. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature thermal processing on the mechanical and degradation attributes of a lean Mg-Zn-Ca-Mn alloy, ZX10. Utilizing cost-efficient characterization methods like X-ray diffraction and optical/scanning electron microscopy, we swiftly examine microstructural changes post-thermal treatment. Employing Pearson correlation coefficient amd LASSO analysis, we unveil the relationship between microstructural properties and critical targets (hardness and corrosion resistance), and determine dominant microstructural factors.
